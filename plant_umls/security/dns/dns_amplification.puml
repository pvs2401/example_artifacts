actor Attacker
participant "DNS Server (8.8.8.8)" as DNS
participant "Target (198.51.100.2)" as Target

== Attack Initialization ==

Attacker -> DNS: DNS query (ANY request for example.com) with spoofed IP (198.51.100.2)
DNS -> DNS: Process query (e.g., prepare large response data for example.com)
note right of DNS
  Query requests all records for example.com
end note

== Amplified Response ==

DNS -> Target: Large DNS response for example.com
note right of Target
  Response contains extensive data (amplified)
end note
Target -> Target: Overwhelmed with traffic (e.g., service disruption)

note right of DNS
  The DNS server sends a much larger response than the original query
end note

== Prevention Measures ==

note right of DNS
  To prevent DNS amplification attacks:
  1. **Use Rate Limiting**: Limit the rate of DNS responses to mitigate large-scale attacks.
  2. **Disable Open DNS Resolvers**: Ensure DNS servers are not publicly accessible and do not allow recursive queries from unauthorized IPs.
  3. **Implement Response Rate Limiting (RRL)**: Limit the number of responses sent to the same IP address in a given timeframe.
  4. **Use DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC)**: Validate DNS responses to prevent cache poisoning and spoofing.
end note
